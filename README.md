- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @imapug (better known as Chris) I have been working on web development projects for over five years and have a range of expertise in a number of programming languages, databases, and services. My specialties are PHP based MVC frameworks and Python for data analysis and automation tasks. I have experience with hosting, deployment, and server administration with Linux and Windows Server. The thing I love most about programming is the ability to challenge the mind to seek out innovative solutions to problems, as well as a chance to work on fun teams to complete tasks effectively and efficiently.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested mostly in web development and data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning and getting my feet wet with Tensorflow and Keras
